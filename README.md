# tree-gen
Makes random trees using p5.js library

## running
Just open the trees.html page in a browser using p5.js cdn. Tested on Firefox and Chrome; it is a bit more performant on Chromium-based browsers.

Alternatively, the p5.js documentation lists various ways to run the project in a local server. This can help if you want hot reloading.
